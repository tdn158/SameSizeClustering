# SameSizeClustering

A function for creating fixed size clusters, based on a 'distance trade' algorithm. 
Used for geographic applications, in which distance determined by latitude and longitude 
is being minimized. However, can be modified to include different distance dimensions.

This algorithm was developed by Wes Stevenson (http://statistical-research.com/page/3/), 
but never published on Git until now.
